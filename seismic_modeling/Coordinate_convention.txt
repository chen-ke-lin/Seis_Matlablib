Note that in this program which is used to calculate the wavefield of a moment tensor source,
the convention of coordinate systerm follows the definition in Aki & Richards 2002, Fig 4.20 and BOX 4.4.

Right-hand coordinate systerm in Cartesian coordinate.
Relation to the geographical convention: X-North   Y-East   Z-Vertical Down.

Some important parameters related to the Coordinate systerm:
theta: zenith angle, measured form the positive Z-axis, range: [0, pi];
phi: azimuth angle, measured from the positive X-axis to positive Y-axis (positive X-axis is 0, positive Y-axis is pi/2), range: [0, 2pi).

For "measured from the positive X-axis to positive Y-axis", 
we can also say "measured counterclockwise from the positive X-axis seen from the positive Z-axis".
