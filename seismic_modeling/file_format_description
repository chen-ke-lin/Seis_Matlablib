0                            | integer. Input type of seismic moment tensor. 0: use fault geometries (strike-rake-dip) to input moment tensor; 1: directly input seismic moment tensor.
45     45     60             | float-float-float or float-float-float-float-float-float. The fault geometry in degree: strike-rake-dip. Or seismic moment tensor: mxx-myy-mzz-mxy-mxz-myz.

(3) model file, homogeneous model or layered model. If there is only one layer, it is a homogeneous model. For layered models, the bottom layer is assumed to be a half space.
0                                                         | float. Reference starting depth (free surface) in meter, can be negtive or positive. Normally is 0, which means the depth of free surface is 0 (sea-level). Positive means the free surface is below sea-level (at depth); negative means the free surface is above the sea-level; e.g. this reference starting depth of the model = -elevation.
